intro -------------------------------------


HolA bot : Holonomic Art Bot (Holonimoc Drive Bot and Art !)

unlike the usual, more popular differential drive robots, the Holonimoc drive robots can control all the three degrees of freedom possible on a plane (2D).
[ translation along x & y axis and rotation along z axis (i.e yaw movement)]

image : ---- 3D moves + bot architecture ! 

This gives the robot the ability to make art that would otherwise not be possible with the usual two wheeled differential drive robots.

Objective ----------------------------------


Will be deploying the HolA bot in an arena(8 x 8 Feet approx) for performing the desired art work (drawing objects).  

(relate the reason : why performing art activity : can have better visulisation about the bot movemtnts with its trace and also easy to identify the accuracy...
drawing any art with the bot/machine is the case where maximum possible accuracy is required !! the other applications that we are currently thinking of may not
necessarily req such accuracy !)
